# NeuroBrush: Style Transfer

A Neural Style Transfer project leveraging deep learning techniques to merge the content of one image with the artistic style of another. This implementation is based on pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks and uses advanced algorithms to create stunning visual transformations.

---

## Features

- **Content and Style Image Input**: Specify a content image and a style image.
- **Artistic Transformation**: Combine the structure of the content image with the artistic essence of the style image.
- **Customizable Parameters**:
  - Adjust the balance between content and style representation.
  - Configure the number of iterations for optimization.
- **Output**: High-quality artistic outputs in PNG format.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Deep Learning Framework**: PyTorch
- **Visualization Tools**:
  - `matplotlib` for displaying images.
  - `Pillow` for image manipulation.
- **Pre-Trained Models**: VGG19 for feature extraction.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above
- Installed Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install torch torchvision matplotlib pillow

Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
Install Dependencies: Use the provided requirements.txt file to install all required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Notebook: Open the Jupyter Notebook file (NeuroBrush Style Transfer.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook "NeuroBrush Style Transfer.ipynb"
Usage
Input Preparation:

Place your content image (e.g., content.jpg) and style image (e.g., style.jpg) in the working directory.
Notebook Execution:

Open the Jupyter Notebook and follow the step-by-step instructions.
Adjust parameters like content weight, style weight, and the number of iterations to achieve your desired artistic effect.
Save the Output:

After running the notebook, the stylized image will be saved as output.jpg in the working directory.
Example Results
Content Image	Style Image	Stylized Image
Replace path/to/content.jpg, path/to/style.jpg, and path/to/output.jpg with actual paths to your images.

To-Do
Replace placeholder links (e.g., <your-username>, <repo-name>, email, and LinkedIn profile).
Add a requirements.txt file if it is not already created.
Include sample images (content.jpg, style.jpg, and output.jpg) in the repository for demonstration.
